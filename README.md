**Hangman** is a classic word game in which the aim is to discover the missing word.

### How to play?
You will be shown a number of blank areas that represent the missing letters you must discover.
To guess a letter, use the keyboard.
If your selected letter appears in the response, all locations where that letter appears will be disclosed.
After revealing multiple letters, you might be able to guess the solution and fill in the missing letters.
**Be warned**: every time you guess a letter incorrectly, you lose a life and the hangman appears in pieces.
